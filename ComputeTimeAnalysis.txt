was run with a 

360 seconds:

for i = 1: numel(Centroids)
pt = centroids(1,:);
D = statslib.gpu.pdist2(pt, P);
end

430 seconds:

pt = centroids(1,:);

end



Other comparison is if we convert to a GPU array from the start:




Alternatively, we could come up with a radial distribution function approach but this would be a memory intensive process... at a first glance...

You would need to sum in some efficient manner.....
