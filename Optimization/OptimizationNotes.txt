The reports contained herein suggest that it takes about ~14 seconds to isotropically interpolate about ~1600 rows of an image. In comparison, the 2048x11000x80 image stack was then isotropically interpolated to 2048x11000x154 in ~30 seconds. This suggest an optimization of nearly 10x by avoiding the use of interp3 in favor of the following algorithm: a permutation of the array to have the z dimension as the rows, using interp1 to interpolate, then permuting the dimensions back so that z slices are again along the third dimension of the array.
